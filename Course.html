                <h3>Web developer</h3>
                <p>I have been continuously learning throughout my journey in the rapidly developing field of computer science and coding, always looking to increase my knowledge and skill set. Currently, I am fully preoccupied with completing various courses on multiple platforms, each of which contributes to different aspects of computer science.

                </p>
                <p>Throughout my learning journey, I have explored various platforms and sources that have proven helpful in improving my coding and problem-solving skills. Courses from respected organisations such as Microsoft, Freecodecamp, Shecodes, and the Harvard CS50 have provided me with a solid foundation in computer science. These courses have not only improved my ability to write code but have also developed my understanding of the underlying theories and principles of computer science.
                </p>
                <p>I also realised how important cybersecurity is becoming in today's digital environment. To better provide myself with the knowledge and skills required to tackle cyber threats, I have engaged in cybersecurity training on platforms such as Cybrary, Tryhackme, and IBM. These resources have immersed me in the world of cybersecurity, enabling me to understand practical solutions to counteract cyber threats effectively.
                </p>
                <p>While I acknowledge that the courses I am undertaking require significant time and effort and may take months to complete, I am committed to investing the required time and effort to ensure I possess the skill set required to excel in the field of computer science and obtain the necessary knowledge and certifications.</p>
                <p>Overall, my path in the field of computer science has been marked by a strong commitment to learning and development. Through courses on various platforms, I have developed my coding, problem-solving skills, and foundational knowledge in computer science. Furthermore, my engagement in cybersecurity training has equipped me with the practical skills needed to address cyber threats effectively. With a commitment to ongoing learning, I plan on becoming the best version of myself in the tech industry.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, SpringPod has been a valuable platform in my journey to connect with companies and gain industry awareness. Through SpringPod, I have been able to explore various organizations and learn about their operations, culture, and opportunities. This platform has served as a bridge between me and the professional world, allowing me to make meaningful connections and gain insights into different industries. I also gained a certificate a while back for fashion work experience. Gaining a certificate for fashion work experience on SpringPod was a significant achievement for me and added an extra aspect to my skill set. </p>
