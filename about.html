                <h3>Developer / Designer</h3>
                <p>Hey there! I'm a sixth form student with a diverse set of interests. I'm aspiring to be a 'Software Developer', 'Fashion Designer', and perhaps 'Graphic Designer' — yes, quite the mix! 
                    I find joy in coding; it's like unlocking a world of endless possibilities. 
                    Problem-solving is like a special ability that I seem to have, and every coding challenge feels like solving a puzzle that I can't wait to crack. 
                    Beyond the tech industry, I'm also passionate about fashion and graphic design, where I can let my creativity run wild. Whether it's writing lines of code or sketching out a new design, 
                    the process of creation is what truly drives me. I'm on a journey of self-discovery, exploring the exciting intersection of technology and design.
                </p>
                <p>As I explored a variety of challenging situations that interested me, I became aware of how software development, fashion, and graphic design complement each other. In software development, I not only honed my coding skills but also gained an appreciation for creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. This has translated well into my passion for design, where the ability to code enhances my understanding of the technical aspects and vice versa. The combination of these worlds gave me a unique perspective, allowing me to solve problems with full reasoning. My journey isn’t just about pursuing specific career paths but also about making connections between seemingly disparate fields and finding connections between engineering and design. It’s this collaborative approach that fuels my vision and creates a future in which I can make a meaningful contribution to both the tech and design communities.</p>
